Instructions: Download sudoku_solver.py, solver_settings.py, and main.py. Ensure that pygame has been installed on your system. Run the main.py file which will launch the
pygame UI. Enter the puzzle that you would like to solve and click the "Solve Puzzle" button. Once the puzzle has been solved, you can click "Clear Puzzle" to clear the
Sudoku board and enter in a new puzzle.

Note: The visual UI limits the solution speed. If you would just like to solve a puzzle quickly, you can use the file named back_propagation_algorithm.py. In this file, you can go to the bottom and manipulate the variable named "sudoku_puzzle" to be the puzzle you would like to solve. Simply run this file after you've entered your puzzle and the puzzle will
be solved with the solution presented in a human-readable format.
